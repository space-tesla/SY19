Model the following Laptop manufacturing information system as a
graph model, and answer the following queries using Cypher.
Consider an Laptop manufacturing industries which produces different
types of laptops. A customer can buya laptop, recommend or rate a the
product.
1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and
draw a high-level Graph model. [3]
2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and
visualize your actual Graph model.[3]
3. Answer the Queries
a. List the characteristics of…….. laptop. [3]
b. List the name of customers who bought a “DELL” company
laptop [3]
c. List the customers who purchase a device on “26/01/2023”[4]
d. List the most recommended device.[4]




# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the Laptop manufacturing information system graph model
use laptop_manufacturing_db

# Step 3: Create collections and insert data for laptops, customers, and reviews
db.laptops.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, brand: "DELL", model: "Inspiron 15", characteristics: ["Intel i5", "8GB RAM", "512GB SSD"] },
  { _id: 2, brand: "HP", model: "Pavilion 14", characteristics: ["Intel i7", "16GB RAM", "1TB SSD"] },
  { _id: 3, brand: "Lenovo", model: "ThinkPad X1", characteristics: ["Intel i9", "32GB RAM", "1TB SSD"] }
])

db.customers.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Alice", purchased_laptops: [1, 2], review: { laptopId: 1, rating: 5, recommendation: "Yes" }, purchase_date: "2023-01-25" },
  { _id: 2, name: "Bob", purchased_laptops: [1], review: { laptopId: 1, rating: 4, recommendation: "No" }, purchase_date: "2023-01-26" },
  { _id: 3, name: "Charlie", purchased_laptops: [3], review: { laptopId: 3, rating: 5, recommendation: "Yes" }, purchase_date: "2023-01-20" }
])

# Step 4: Write the queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the characteristics of a given laptop, for example, "DELL Inspiron 15"
db.laptops.aggregate([
  { $match: { brand: "DELL", model: "Inspiron 15" } },
  { $project: { characteristics: 1 } }
])

# b. List the name of customers who bought a "DELL" laptop
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $match: { "purchased_laptops": 1 } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "laptops",
    localField: "purchased_laptops",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "laptop_info"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$laptop_info" },
  { $match: { "laptop_info.brand": "DELL" } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# c. List the customers who purchased a device on "26/01/2023"
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $match: { purchase_date: "2023-01-26" } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# d. List the most recommended device (laptop with highest recommendation rating)
db.laptops.aggregate([
  { $lookup: {
    from: "customers",
    localField: "_id",
    foreignField: "purchased_laptops",
    as: "customer_reviews"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$customer_reviews" },
  { $match: { "customer_reviews.review.recommendation": "Yes" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$model", recommendation_count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { recommendation_count: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 },
  { $project: { _id: 0, model: "$_id", recommendation_count: 1 } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
